List of things to be done, regarding log_processor:

01. Join all configuration objects in one - that is, extend Config class to support command
    line parameters and table 'settings'. Maybe convert PHP config to some *.ini file, then
    just leave DB credentials there and move everyting other to the 'settings' table.

02. Split script into separate modules: log parser, data savers (this could be splitted even more
    into separate modules for message rate, logs and counters), and triggers. Then create one 
    module to manage the above. This is introduction to the paralell processing

03. Implement paralell processing (provided task 02 is done) - have separate threads 
    for parsing, saving data to different parts of storage, and triggers.

04. Prepare unit tests for parser module - check only input/output that is - for given input line
    expect given hash with proper fields.

05. Having 04 done, implement new, faster parser module - probably as an XS, maybe with some
    external rules defined in configuration file(s), so it can be easily extended with new cases.
