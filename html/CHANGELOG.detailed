 To use the new lzrc option, create a file named scripts/.lzrc and add/modify the following properties:
#------------------# 
# basic properties # 
#------------------# 
$dbroot = "root"; 
$dbrootpass = "mysql";
$dbname = "syslog"; 
$dbhost = "localhost";
$dbport = "3306";  
$dbadmin = "syslogadmin"; 
$dbadminpw = "syslogadmin"; 
$siteadmin = "admin";  
$siteadminpw = "admin"; 
$email = "cdukes\@logzilla.pro";
$sitename = "LogZilla Server";
$url = "/";
$logpath = "/var/log/logzilla";
$retention = "7"; 
$snare = "N";
#------------------# 
# Skip section options
# This may mess up the installation of you haven't already installed
# The dev teams use this to avoid having to set up everything repeatedly during testing
#------------------# 
$skipdb = "N";
$skipcron = "N";

   This is a problem with their network devices not sending the correct timestamps, so we will use the server's TS instead.

 - Fixed bug: unable to search for all notes (!='')
 - Fixed bug: check security - accessing pages as a non-admin
 - Added Catch the enter key on the main search page.
 - Added version detail for each release to help>about
 - Changed: note editor was ugly
 - Added: Ad-hoc charts
 - Added: Save of adhoc charts (note: saved charts will appear under the Charts menu)
 - Added: graph image export
 - Added: graph data export to excel
 - Wishlist: combine the above 2 so that excel contains the graph
 - Todo: format the excel exports - could be *way* better

3.0Beta14
- Lots of great stuff!
- Auto-refresh (Tail) is now available.
    Tail Notes:
    - It doesn't work the old way where you just had the whole page refresh, now it just refreshes the data in the page - welcome to the wonderful world of ajax :-)
    - I am still shocked at just how bad IE handles things... (it doesn't like the tail feature, it also refuses to stop caching the charts regardless of what I try).
    - Session timeout will not cause the tail page to stop working - so you can leave it running in your NOC. Note that if you navigate away, your expired session will then kick in and you'll need to re-login (but the url gets passed).
- Added POST/GETs to/from the URL (you can manually enter your desired page and get what you want)
- Added a URL save feature - after you search, you can click on the DISK icon in the results portlet to save that search. Saved searches will become available on the "History" menu after page refresh.
- Added portal counts (all portals on the main page will show how many of each are found in the DB)
    Portal counts:
    - Systems with very high load may miss portal counts (>1500mps) but this won't affect operation. Also, you can disable portal counts in the settings table if you think it's slwoing you down.
- Added a couple more charts
    Chart Notes:
    - Turned off the auto-refresh on the mps chart - there's just too much load with that many charts on a page (I'll probably split them into multiple pages someday).
    - Did some scale testing - the server I'm developing on had 20m events and 30,000 hosts - query times are almost instant still.  the only exception is, of course, the charts, but they are cached (30 minutes for top hosts, 60 for top messages), so the next time you load the page it's fast.
    - The Top messages chart gets dreadfully slow on larger systems - with 20m events, I got tired of waiting after about 3 minutes and killed the process. This is fairly understandable considering what it's trying to do (but I will continue to work on making it better).
- Added Server Date and Time display on the main page (Datetime portlet). This will help you determine if your incoming logs match the server's time.
- MODIFIED db_insert to use File::Tail instead of piping messages in.
    This will allow syslog-ng to buffer all messages to disk so we don't drop anything on systems with high insert rates.
    Also added a -b (background) option to the script to daemonize it - this will allow you to call it from /etc/init.d
    To run db_insert - call it with these parameters:
    -t /path_to_logs/syslog.log -b (-t specifies the file to tail, -b will daemonize it)
    scale tests:
    using tail - no messages were dropped by logzilla, however: using UDP - I sent 20k events over the network at around 400 mps and syslog-ng only logged about 4300 (this is not syslog-ng's fault, it's the nature of UDP).
    NOTE: You will probably need to install the File::Tail cpan module
    NOTE 2: Be sure to set up log rotation for your /path_to_logs directory (there's a sample config under contrib) unless you want to fill your HDD.
- Probably a lot I forgot to write down (did I already mention column sorting and filtering on severity?)


3.0 Beta13 (beta's 11 and 12 were small patches)
- Added additional field for notes searching
- Added watermarks in notes and messages search boxes with a count of the current entries for each
- Fixed DBD execute error on install.pl (removed reference to old column in the table)
- Fixed SITE_URL for edit_sm.png in the table portlet (remove extra /)
- Fixed bug: http://logzilla.pro/index.php?topic=77.new#new (24 hour time on mps graph)
- Added selectable search paramaters for messages and notes (you can now search using "=", "!=", "LIKE", "NOT LIKE", "RLIKE" and "NOT RLIKE")


3.0Beta10
- Removed msg2hex conversion - it wasn't allowing for case-insensitive searches or regex.
- Replaced the grid in the search results - the original grid had a display bug that creator won't fix, and, quite honestly, I like what I have now much better!
- Removed all tab functions and am now using posts/gets - this will allow for url saving and also speeds up page loads.
- Added in Excel (and now PDF) exporting capability
- Added severity color-coding back in
- Added filters for severities on the results page.
- Fixed some of the queries (they should be a lot faster now...I hope)
- Added counts for each portlet on the main page (so it shows something like "2,102,192 Messages" instead of just "Messages"
- Built a new nav menu that (I hope) suits the interface better.
- Almost have the server-settings table working, waiting for a response from the grid creator.
- Theme switcher doesn't appear to work in IE (there's a shocker).
- Added URL post/get capabilities (you can now enter searches on the URL line)
- Added a search save feature - allows you to save searches for later retrieval, just click on the DISK icon on the search results header.
- Note that host and messages charts are cached! Change the cache timeout in the settings table if you don't like the defaults :-)
- Added missing files (images missing in apache error.log)
- Added naming feature to saved searches (it was just saving the url)


3.0beta9
Bug Fixes and enhancements

- Mysql partitioning shuts off across restarts - be sure to add it in your my.cnf as noted here: http://logzilla.pro/index.php/topic,71.0.html
- CAN'T FIX - bug: http://logzilla.pro/index.php/topic,33.0.html (<foo@com> truncated in messages - see http://logzilla.pro/index.php/topic,33.0.html)
- FIXED - bug: http://logzilla.pro/index.php/topic,51.0.html (wrong sequence in MPD chart)
- FIXED - bug: http://logzilla.pro/index.php?topic=49.new;topicseen#new (use "127.0.0.1" as $dbserver instead of "localhost")
- Mostly Addressed - bug/enhancements: http://logzilla.pro/index.php?topic=55.new#new
- FIXED - bug: http://logzilla.pro/index.php?topic=54.new#new (missing images in apache error log)
- OUTSOURCED - enhancements: http://logzilla.pro/index.php?topic=42.new#new (db_insert.pl cpu usage)

- Note: MAJOR CHANGES
- I've build in new code that converts all incoming messages to HEX values - this will allow for much smaller tables and should help query speeds. To convert them back to normal, you can use the msg_decode function included in common_funcs.php
- Added a new caching table to address slow drawing times on larger charts

3.0
Lots of changes, this will no doubt need to be a fresh install. Sorry, but upgrading would be next to impossible.

 - THIS VERSION OF LOGZILLA REQUIRES MYSQL 5.1 OR BETTER

 - Re-wrote most of the frontend code - new interface (yay!)
 - Replaced old graphs with shiny new ones
 - Added MySQL Partitioning to the log table and removed the need for any logrotation.
 - Added MySQL Events for automatic Partitioning each day. Partitions will be removed after 30 days by default.
 - Cleaned up a TON of old code.
 - Removed $LEVEL from syslog-ng.conf as it is the exact same thing as the PRIORITY macro.
 - Removed LEVEL from db_insert.pl and all related php files.
 - Built new navigation menu which also includes a new Admin page for setting all site variables.
 - Moved most of the config.php settings to a table in the database, all settings can now be modifed using the new admin page from the pulldown menu.
 - Changed all files to use settings table instead of config.php
 - db_insert.pl is now capable of processing 38,000 Messages per second without dropping any. It will have a lag on processing them, but not a single message was dropped during my tests.
 - Removed dbgen.pl, use the new logreplay.pl instead for testing which will actually send message to syslog-ng instead of just inserting dummy data into the MySQL table.
	note: you will need to compile spoof_syslog.c in order to use it.
	to compile, simply type "gcc spoof_syslog.c -o ./spoof_syslog"
 - Added Sphinx FULL TEXT search capabilities
	More information can be found at http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html
	You'd better read it :-)
 - Replaced the search message box on the main page with a Sphinx search. This new search allows for many more search options
	Feel free to explore the different types at: http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html#searching
 - Hid search query when debug is enabled and Sphinx is used. The results would take up the whole page. 
	To see the query, view page source instead.
 - Changed CRONTAB entries, be aware! Please look at the scripts/contrib/system_configs/crontab file.
 - Changed the search_cache to a MyISAM table type. Memory type wasn't working well on smaller systems with low ram and the table shouldn't get so large (millions of rows) that it would be slow to select rows anyways.
 - Addded several Ajax features in:
	Front page: All "modules" (hosts, programs, facilities, etc.) can be rearranged to the user's liking.
	Search results: the changes here should be obvious, but it's all done through a json backend now.
 - Added query logging in order to help debug long/bad queries. To enable set it in config.php

Needs testing:
 - Certificate based authentication: I have no way to test this.

2.9.9o
 - Removed the OPTIMIZE command from log rotation due to slow response in larger DB's
 - Fixed bug in reloadcache that was deleting cache entries before checking to see if they even needed updating (essentially causing lpdcache to re-insert all cache data for all tables on every run).
 - Modified common_funcs.php to use a SELECT DISTINCT on the program field instead of using array_unique in order to speed up queries in larger DB's.

2.9.9n
 - Modified the way program names are inserted into the DB from db_insert.pl 
   (stripped the full path so that only the program name itself would be inserted)
 - Modified the reload_cache function in common_funcs.php to not use RLIKE
 - Modified fixpaths.sh to do a little better error checking
 - Fix a bug in regularresult.php where $msg should have been called as $row['msg']

2.9.9m
Enhancement
 - Added the ability to filter by clicking on the severity legend at the top right of the search results.
   See http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=124 for more detail.

2.9.9l
 - Removed the previously applied patch for sorting by id field as secondary - it was messing up sorting on fields when deduplication was enabled - http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=132
 - Added the source code for spoof_syslog into the contrib/logreplay/ directory

2.9.9k
 - Added a specific regex filter for Fortigate Firewalls to the db_insert.pl script. Apparently Fortigate decided to create their own syslog standard :-)
 - Added crontab change as requested in http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=90&can=1
 - Added better escape handling for search form - fix for http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=111
 - Added handling of cache for PROG, FAC, etc. when using the MERGELOGTABLE as CACHETABLENAME in config.php - http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=133
 - Added a second ORDERBY statement to sort by ID in regularresult.php - http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=132

2.9.9j
Updates/Additions/Fixes
 - Added a filter for the SEQ field to disable it from being displayed in regurlarresult.php
 To show it, set SEQ to TRUE in your config.php
 - Minor fix to regularresult.php for sev4 not displaying the proper color
 - Added a file lock to reloadcache.php for larger systems (so we don't overlap scripts after 5 minutes)
 - Added command line options to db_insert.pl, to use, just type "db_insert.pl -h"
 - Added a "self test" option to db_insert.pl, type "db_insert.pl -h" for instructions
 - Removed comments in reloadcache.php that was not allowing a host count for all_logs when setting USETABLE to MERGELOGTABLE in config.php
 - Added an ABSPATH variable to config.php
 - Modified fixpaths.sh in the scripts/ directory to use the ABSPATH variable

2.9.9i
Minor Update
 - db_insert.pl was opening too many instances on some hosts and not exiting in a timeley manner. I added a "wait" for the child process to exit.
 - Added better benchmark time to db_insert.pl

2.9.9h
Minor update
 - Added signal handler to db_insert to avoid zombie processes
 - Added better regex for DBHOST in db_insert.pl to handle dotted hosts
 - Modified scripts/contrib/system_configs/syslog-ng.conf and changed sync() to flush_lines() in order to support newer versions of syslog-ng (v2.x and up)

2.9.9g
Bug fixes
 - Same as 2.9.9b - Fixed a bug in db_insert.pl (forgot to enable inserts when I uploaded back to the project)

2.9.9f
Enhancements
 - Re-worked the forking process in db_insert.pl
 - Now using perl's built-in fork function instead of Parallel::ForkManager - after running multiple tests, I found forkmanager to be about 10x slower. 

2.9.9e
Enhancements
 - More work on db_insert.pl

2.9.9d
Enhancements
 - Worked on forking for db_insert.pl a bit more

2.9.9c
Bug fixes
 - Fixed regex in db_insert.pl to work with messages not sending a program field
 - Added internal timestamps to inserted messages versus incoming timestamps
 - Added a fixpaths.sh script to the scripts/directory to update paths in all files

2.9.9b
Bug fixes
 - Fixed a bug in db_insert.pl (forgot to enable inserts when I uploaded back to the project)

2.9.9a
Bug fixes
 - Added forking to db_insert.pl to eliminate high CPU utilization
 - Fixed a big nasty bug that wasn't getting all the duplicates properly when SQZ was enabled

2.9.9 (Beta)
New features (yay!)
Lots of changes, so it's really important that you read the details section following the summary below.
####
# Summary of changes:
####
* 1. Export to Excel Spreadheet from regularresult.php and from graphs (doesn't export the graph, exports the rows found)
* 2. Message Filtering (messages will explode and allow filtering on each piece of the message)
* 3. New Graph Types (on main search page, select "Graph Type")
* 4. Removed the DATETIME column from the database as it is exactly the same as the FO column
* 5. Globally replaced count(*) with SUM(counter) and removed checks for SQZ to decide which one to use
* 6. db_insert.pl has the capability to deduplicate messages. (SqueezeDB.php will be removed from the source code).
* 7. Changes to syslog-ng.conf - read the Details section below.
* 8. Patched login.php and common_funcs.php
* 9. Added a contrib directory under scripts/ and moved some files there that were in the scripts/ directory
* 10. Added a logreplay.pl script to the contrib directory
* 11. Added a minor fix to display SEQ field properly in regularresult.php

####
# Detailed Information: you better read this, it's pretty important :-)
####
* 1. Added ability to export search results to Excel (includes support for Excel5, Excel 2007 and CSV)
	The Excel library I've included is very cool - I encourage you to make your reports better looking!
	Visit http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/ to learn more.
	Please contribute back if you come up with something fancy/cool!
* 2. Added option to filter search results on individual pieces of messages (set MSG_EXPLODE in config.php)
* 3. Added new "Graph Type" dropdown to the main search menu. This will allow searching for TopX: Hosts, Messages, Priorities, etc.
	instead of the original which was to just graph on Top Hosts.
	Please be aware that searching for Top Messages can take a *really* long time on larger databases 
	(this is because Mysql has to calculate large rows of text which cannot be indexed)
* 4. The original DATETIME column has been removed from all tables (and code). The reason is that the FO (first occurrence) 
     column is exactly the same (it's the first time we saw that message). 
* 5. When I implemented the SQZ feature, I had to do checks everywhere to decide how to get current counts,
	but it occured to me that since every message is inserted with a default counter of 1, there's no need 
	to of an if-then in the code - I can just do a SUM(counter) for any row and still arrive at the same answer.
* 6. Moved the SQZ feature to the db_insert.pl script that will provide much better message deduplication than 
	the old php version (SqueezeDB.php).
	(If Squeeze is disabled in your config.php, the script will simply insert records as normal)
	Note: Enabling this feature will increase CPU usage since it has to query the database and perform functions 
	such as updating and deleting records, etc.
	I make no guarantees as to the scalability of the function - it will likely slow down message insertion rates. 
	In my testing, the max insert rate I could achieve was around 215 messages per second (at which point, messages 
	started dropping from the buffer) - which is pretty fast, but if you have a large network 
	(like 10-20,000 devices) I'd probably recommend you not use this feature.
	To enable this feature:
	A. In config.php, set SQZ_ENABLED to TRUE
		You will also want to set the other SQZ* variables to suit your needs such as TIME and DIST

* 7. Patched login.php and common_funcs.php for the following issues:
	http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=73
	http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=35
* 8. Moved some files to contrib to help clean up the scripts/ directory
* 9. Created contrib/logreplay/logreplay.pl to allow someone to "replay" a syslog dump file back into the syslog receiver.
	It's meant for Cisco messages only, so if you want to use it for something else you may need to alter the regex in the script.
	Note that as of this version of the script, the following vars aren't used:
        # $host
        # $month
        # $day
        # $time
    I would like to figure out a way to rewite the syslog packet to show these fields but can't figure out how just yet.
    If you know how, please tell me :-)

===================================================================================================================================
2.9.8m
- Changed msg parsing regex for cisco abbreviations (configurable by the config parameter CISCO_TAG_PARSE) to avoid issue 84.
- Changed datetimepicker format for calendar to output a more international form.
- Improved time regex validation.
- Applied patch for issue 104.
- Fixed 'Allowed memory size exhausted' when reloading cache (see issue 86).
- Changed type for id column from mediumint to bigint unsigned. Also made seq column unsigned.
    You can do the following procedure if you wish to update your current table structure and minimize downtime:
	DROP TABLE all_logs;
	Create a templog table with the new structure (see the create statement at html/install/sql/dbsetup.sql)
	ALTER TABLE logs RENAME oldlogs;
	ALTER TABLE templog RENAME logs;
	INSERT logs (host,facility,priority,level,tag,datetime,program,msg,seq,counter,fo,lo) select 
	host,facility,priority,level,tag,datetime,program,msg,seq,counter,fo,lo from oldlogs;
	DROP TABLE oldlogs; (if everything went well)
  
    For the rest of log tables, you can just run this query for each log table:
	ALTER TABLE logsYmd MODIFY id bigint unsigned not null auto_increment, MODIFY seq bigint unsigned;

2.9.8k
- Fixed a few bugs that got introduced...

2.9.8g
* Update
- Fixed Calendar (changed to a better date picker)
- Changed SQL type for 'seq' in the database from auto_increment to int
	to update your version just type:
	ALTER TABLE logs MODIFY seq bigint(20);
	from within mysql
	NOTE: this will mess up your MERGE table, you must change it on all old tables as well and re-run logrotate.php to create a new ALL_LOGS table.

- Fix for SqueezeDB not passing tables properly - Thanks Robin!
  Email from Robin:
  ###################
 // CDUKES: Aug 7, 2008: Added for command line passing of tables
$Tables = array();
if ($argc > 1) {
        foreach ($argv as $arg) {
                if ($arg != $argv[0]) {
                        $tableArray = get_logtables($dbLink);

echo "flush tables" | mysql -usyslogadmin -psyslogadmin syslog >> /var/log/php-syslog-ng/squeeze.log
  ###################



2.9.8f
* Update
- re-commented out the check for all_logs in reloadcache.php - it's not scaling properly on large systems. Also, I don't see the need for it since we're caching on ea
ch log individually this way instead of relying on a massive search through a merge table.
- Added Certificate Based Authentication by Miguel Tormo
  Ref: http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/wiki/CertificateAuthentication

2.9.8e
* Update
- Fix for lpdcache not detecting when SQZ was disabled
  There's a .patch file in the scripts directory if you just want to run that against your 2.9.8d install
  just run: patch -p0 < lpdcache.patch in the scripts/ directory

2.9.8d
* Update
- Fix for tailresult not displaying columns correctly

2.9.8c
* Update
- Forgot to include the new reloadcache.php
- Fixed missing config.php.dist

- Changed DEBUG in config.php from '0' to FALSE
- Re-enabled SQL output on search results if DEBUG=TRUE
- Added sql staments for Mysql 5.x users to fix problem with drop and alter commands (http://nms.gdd.net/index.php/Installation_Guide#Caveats)
- Fixed javascript populate for "duplicates" field on search page
- Fixed SqueezeDB issue where duplicate count was not updating properly (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=70)
- Added SQZ Savings calculation to search page (shows how much of a percentage the SqueezeDB script has saved overall - shows up next to the "Duplicates" dropdown as a percentage)
- Altered graphit.php to show results based on SQZ if enabled.
- Found and fixed a few more short tags  (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=20&can=1&q=tag)
- Modified SqueezeDB to handle large systems a little better - please read changes in scripts/SqueezeDB-v2.2.php
- Fixed a bug in reloadcache.php that was trying to cache the merge table which slows reloadcache down considerably on large systems (
  // Ref: http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=73
- Changed the LPD graph to display numbers in a more readable manner (such as 2.4M instead of 2400000) (see blocks/graph-logs_per_day.php)
- Added Caching for front page graphs for performance increase
  Note: NEW FILE ADDED - ldpcache.php in the scripts directory which is called from reloadcache.php
  Note2: This REQUIRES a change to your search_cache table:
  ALTER TABLE search_cache MODIFY type enum('HOST','FACILITY','PROGRAM','LPD') default NULL
- Added SQZ (fo,lo, counter) and LPD (LPD) columns to the install SQL file.
- Fixed errors when CEMDB = OFF, REF: http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=68

  // Ref: http://groups.google.com/group/php-syslog-ng-support/browse_thread/thread/eda3c96999889b47
- Added Web Basic Auth to login for mod_auth_krb5 users
  // Ref: http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=62
- Removed search page option: Collapse Identical Messages (it never worked and is replaced by the squeezeDB functionality)
- Added search page option for "Duplicates" - only shows up if 'SQZ_ENABLED = TRUE' in confg.php
  This option allows you to search for any duplicate lines created by the SqueezeDB feature.
- Removed CALLHOME, it was fairly useless :-)
- Modified distribution tar in response to http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=66

2.9.7 
* Updates/Enhancements
!!! IMPLEMENTED SqueezeDB.php file in scripts/ !!!
- Be sure you add this to your CRON!
NOTE: If you have a very large database (more than 10k rows in 5 minutes), it WILL NOT scale. 
Next release I hope to have a more scalable solution in place.
More info on this is at http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=47
  Cron Entry for SqueezeDB:
 */5 * * * * php /www/php-syslog-ng/scripts/SqueezeDB-v2.0.php >> /var/log/php-syslog-ng/squeezedb.log 

   NOTE: Versions of php-syslog-ng 2.9.5d and below will need to alter the database to use this script
   ALTER TABLE logs ADD counter INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1;
   ALTER TABLE logs ADD fo datetime default NULL;
   ALTER TABLE logs ADD lo datetime default NULL;

- Added LDAP Auth section for Microsoft AD
- Added 'DEMO' to config.php to change login page notification of demo site
- Added FO, LO, and Count fields for squeezdb implementation
- Added config.php variable for calculating hostcount on search page
- Fixed a bug in login.php that wasn't notifying you of a failed password auth (it just put you back to the login screen)
- Fixed bug for missing TAIL_REFRESH_SECONDS from config.php on new installation (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=51)
- Added a small "callhome" feature includes/callhome.php to help me get an idea of demographics - enable or disable in config.php (CALLHOME) setting.
- Fixed FO, LO and COUNT Sort fields (added logic for sorting) in regularresult.php

2.9.6
* Enhancements
- Changed "DEFINE("TTF_DIR","/usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/");" in includes/jpgraph/jpg-config.inc
- Modified logrotate.php to allow for better error handling of duplicate tables 
- Also removed myisamchk since it was causing table crashes for people.
- Added new performance testing tools to scripts/tests/ (see README in that directory for info)
- Modified reloadcache to remove caching based off of MERGELOGTABLE only, it was redundant.
- MODIFIED DATABASE TABLE "search_cache", please update your tables to this:
------------------- BEGIN SQL MODIFICATION---------------------
mysql> drop table search_cache;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE TABLE `search_cache` (`tablename` varchar(32) default NULL,`type` enum('HOST','FACILITY','PROGRAM') default NULL, `value` varchar(128) default NULL, `updatetime` datetime default NULL,   INDEX `type_name` (`type`,`tablename`) ) ENGINE=MEMORY;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
------------------- END SQL MODIFICATION---------------------
- Note that I added a 'PROGRAM' field to the enum and changed the database engine to MEMORY.

- Fixed broken links for Common Graphs (line wrap was breaking the url)
- Fixed search criteria for "Today" graph (it was searching the MERGELOGTABLE instead of DEFAULTLOGTABLE which take a *long* time on large systems
- Fixed small cosmetic bug in graph output (it was showing a count of total hosts, instead of a sum of total rows found for TopX)
- Fixed minor cosmetic issues with graph results (displaying total rows in results_subheader, displaying topx on graph)
- Implemented Regex search capabilities provided by bpkroth (Big thanks!)
  http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=31
 Changes as noted by bpkroth:
 - Added a program list similar to hosts.
 - Optional RegExp matching of hosts, programs, and messages
 - If RegExp matching is not used, the host/program "like" fields will
   accept comma or semicolon delimited lists of hosts to match
 - A slight cosmetic change to the message input area so they line up.
 - Results pages display the facility, program and host, as links for one click filtering.
 - Results page headers allow you to adjust the results ordering via a link.
 - Removed popups from messages that aren't found in CEMDB
 - Date is only displayed if it's different from today
 - Previously if $row['count'] > 1, CEMDB messages were never shown. This is fixed.
 - Search page now uses $_SESSION variables to remember what you last entered into the form
   so you can easily adjust the query rather than having to start over from scratch
 - Added the ability to define the refresh rate of the tail page in config.php.
   Make sure you configure your server to Allow overrides (AllowOverride Options)
   Ref: http://us2.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php

2.9.5d
* Minor fixes
- Small bug fix

2.9.5b
* Minor fixes
- Fixed Issue 36 (logrotate errors) http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=36
  note that you need to re-grant priveleges (GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on syslog.* to syslogadmin@'%';) to fix this.
- Removed include from common_funcs for config.php and moved it to login.php
  it was messing up the reloadcache.php
- Fixed issue #45 (unable to use "ACL = FALSE" in config.php)
  http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=45


2.9.5a
* Minor fixes
- Added a .htaccess file to check for proper php global settings 
- note that you must set "AllowOverride All" in your apache config to allow .htaccess to work.
- Modified the regex match for cemdb stuff in tailresult and 
  regularresult on incoming syslog messages to make it look better
- removed a couple of old files

2.9.5
* Lots of code changes
- Sorry...no upgrade for this one...I screwed up and used 2.9.3l as the base :-)
  However, there are no database changes, so you *should* be able to just copy over your current html/ directory
- Modified UMS to include LDAP Authentication
- New login/logout screen and procedures
- Fixed user ACL check (it only allowed the "admin" user to modify acl's before)
- Fixed php short_open_tag issue: http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=32
- Added fix for issue #36 (logrotate failures) http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=36
- Applied patch for issue #43 (addcslashes) http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=43
- Removed top information bar showing fairly useless information such as user's IP address.
  per request from http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=25
- Added a new favicon.ico and png under images/
- Fixed installer to import CEMDB better and faster
- Reduced install size by quite a bit since the cemdb is now gzipped.
- Did a whole bunch of other things I'm probably forggetting :-0
- Added a paypal link :-)

2.9.4
* New and improved CEMDB (yay!)
- Added note in troubleshooting doc about setting magic quotes to "on"
- Updated CEMDB with new data (about twice as many messages now!)
- Note that this required a change to the CEMDB.class.php file!
- added the "upgrades/" directory so folks could just patch to new versions. 
  (note that you will need to manually install the new CEMDB if you use this method,
  it's located in html/install/sql/cemdb.sql)
  To manually install the new CEMDB:
  1. Backup old sql:
  mysqldump syslog cemdb > cemdb.old.sql
  2. Delete old data from database:
  echo "delete from cemdb" | mysql -usyslogadmin -psyslogadmin syslog
  3. Import new data:
  mysql syslog < html/install/sql/cemdb.sql
  4. Apply upgrade patch:
  patch -p0 < upgrades/2.9.3l_to_2.9.4.patch
  # That should do it, if not, you may need to just re-run the install by zeroing out your config.php file
- Made changes to the way syslog-ng stores its data into mysql (changing the syslog-ng.conf file)
- Thanks go to Michael Baeker for this one!
- Reference: http://www.baecker.com/linux/syslog-ng-in-mysql-datenbank-loggen.html
- These changes no longer require the use of pipes so you'll want to remove:
  "@reboot /www/php-syslog-ng/scripts/syslog2mysql.sh >> /var/log/php-syslog-ng/mysql.log 2>&1"
  From your crontab file (crontab -e to edit the file) after making the changes to syslog-ng.conf.
  Be sure to replace the username and password in the new syslog-ng.conf with the proper credentials.

2.9.3l
* Various fixes
- Added chk_config to index.php to redirect to install screen if config.php is missing settings
- Added check to common_funcs for proper PHP settings 
- Changed function perform_query to do better error handling - added mysql_error() 
- Changed JS to 'JS' in login.php (:%s/JS/'JS'/g)
- fixed missing $add variable in common_funcs.php
- Added .htaccess to make sure register_globals and magic_quotes_gpc were enabled for this site (not necessary globally in php.ini)
- Added somewhat better login handling to login.php

2.9.3k
- Fixed improper check for $username in login.php (removed pointless code)

2.9.3j
* Various Updates/fixes
- Applied cosmetic fix for JS definition missing from g_redirect function (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=24)
- Included configure.php fix for issue 1 (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=1)
- Changed all php shorthand echo's (in the includes directory) to longhand (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=20)
- Applied fix for logrotate.php (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=21)
- Added check for magic quotes to resolve issue 16 (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=16)
- Moved version information from the html_header to about.php
- Cleaned up about.php and appended CHANGELOG info.

2.9.3i
* Ugh
- The patch supplied for CEMDB (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=19)
  display threw an error on my test server, so I changed:
//if (preg_match("/%[:alpha:].*:/", $row['msg']) == 0) {
if (preg_match("/%[[:alpha:]]+$/", $row['msg']) == 0) {
in regularresult.php


2.9.3h
* Minor updates
- Applied CEMDB display patch from Sergio Guzman (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=19)
- Applied speed increase posted by patrickdk77 (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=17)
- Applied PHP Notices patch from emmanuel.crespy (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=18)

2.9.3g
* Applied some fixes posted on the Google Code site
- http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=14
- http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=15
- Created INSTALL-STEPS for step-by-step installation instructions

2.9.3f
* Minor update
- Removed reference to Google Analytics (which I use on my server)
- If you want to use it, just create a file called "includes/google-analytics.html" and add:
	<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">
	</script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
	_uacct = "ACCTNUMBER";
	urchinTracker();
	</script>
(Replace ACCTNUMBER with your analytics account number)

2.9.3e
* Minor fix to my previous minor fix :-)
- After converting the eol characters to carriage returns, it had placed an extra ^M at the bottom of common_funcs.php
  (after the last ?>) which causes headers to get messed up in php and throw a "headers already sent" error.
  
2.9.3d
* Minor Fix
- It appears that includes/common_funcs.php was missing eol characters...


2.9.3c
* Minor fixes
- Changed path to config.php in scripts/drop-old-tables.php
- Restored config.php.dist (it was empty)
- Made some minor changes to scripts/resetusers.sh

2.9.3b
* Minor fixes
- zero'd out config.php to allow the installer to run
- Added memory fix to the TROUBLESHOOTING-INSTALL doc:

2.9.3a
* Minor fixes to 2.9.3
- Increased minimum memory requirements from 64M to 128M
- Removed duplicate table creation of the cemdb table from the install gui 
  (2.9.3 made a change to it and I mistakenly created the table twice instead of replacing it)
- Had to replace cemdb.sql from Daniel Berlin <mail@daniel-berlin.de> with the old one. 
  The new one was preventing the installer from working properly...not sure why.
  The new one from him has been renamed to "cemdb.dberlin" in the install/sql directory
  Once the web install completes, you can load the newer format by doing the following:
  # echo "delete from cemdb;" | mysql syslog
  # mysql -u<user> -p syslog < cemdb.dberlin 
  replace "<user>" and "syslog" accordingly.
  I don't know why his imports fine from the command line but fails during the install. 
  Anyone wanna take a crack at it?
- Added "resetusers.sh" into the scripts directory. This script will 
  DELETE ALL USERS and add the username/passwords for "admin/admin" and "demo/demo"


2.9.3
* Minor fixes included from Daniel Berlin <mail@daniel-berlin.de>
- Issue # 8 patched (http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng/issues/detail?id=8&can=1&q=)
- Fixed missing field in emd.pl (Cisco Error Message Database)
  Notes from Daniel:
  The current version fails to extract the 'message' field
  (3rd field, see below):
 Generated by old emd.pl >>>
  78836,'%C4K_POWERSHELF-3-INVALIDPACKETRECEIVED','ARRAY(0xc54eba0)','This
  message indicates that the GCP protocol stack has received a packet of
  an unexpected type. This is a transient error condition; the protocol
  might recover automatically on the next discovery cycle.','This is an
  informational message only. No action is required.','2006-07-03 15:53:41')
 <<<
 Generated by new emd.pl >>>
  C4K_POWERSHELF-3-INVALIDPACKETRECEIVED
  (3006, '%C4K_POWERSHELF-3-INVALIDPACKETRECEIVED', 'We got an invalid
  packet', 'This message indicates that the GCP protocol stack has
  received a packet of an unexpected type. This is a transient error
  condition; the protocol might recover automatically on the next
  discovery cycle.', 'This is an informational message only. No action is
  required.', '2007-02-14 14:56:17')
 <<<
- Daniel added a new Class for CEMDB lookups (CEMDB.class.php)
  It caches entries already looked up in the cem database
  and results in much less database load.
  E.g. If there are 10 messages like this one:
  %AAA-3-IPILLEGALMSG: Fan 1 had a rotation error reported.
  %AAA-3-IPILLEGALMSG: Fan 2 had a rotation error reported. 
- Removed the jpgraph docs and examples (which saves ~6MB 
  and does not change jpgraph's behavior)
  i.e.:
  html/includes/jpgaph/Examples
  and
  html/includes/jpgaph/docs

 
2.9.2a(r14)
* Minor fixes included from Tom Cort <linuxgeek@gmail.com>
- php-syslog-ng-2.9.2a-r13-check-exec-mem-limits.patch - when I was
  using the installer with the load cemdb and load sample data options I
  was getting maximum execution time exceeded and allowed memory size
  exhausted errors. This patch adds those checks to the first page of
  the installer.

- php-syslog-ng-2.9.2a-r13-install-index-html.patch - an HTML tag wasn't
  closed properly, this fixes it.

- php-syslog-ng-2.9.2a-r13-suppress-warnings.patch - php-syslog-ng
  prints a warning when there are database problems. mysql_pconnect and
  mysql_connect print warnings too. The patch suppresses the warnings
  that mysql_pconnect and mysql_connect spit out.

**** IMPORTANT (really all of this is, it's why it's here...)***
- Moved the html/scripts directory to ../ (so that it would not be web accessible)
- Added Mysql.pm in scripts/ which resolves a bug in Net::MySql and MySql 5.x

2.9.2a(r13)
* Minor bugfixes
- Fixed Logrotate.php bug
- F. Leimbach - Add logic to remember the requested query throughout a login
  Made a few changes to this (including allowing the same for the Tail function)
- Added user guide (Word Doc)
- Added check to see if config.php was filled in and redirect to install if not.
- Enhancements made to dbgen.pl so that I could use it with cron.

2.9.2a
* Minor bugfixes
- added htmlentities filter to $info in regularresult and tailresult since some messages contained odd characters in the CEMDB.
- Changed setcookie function - it was doing some weird timeout stuff

2.9.2
* Uh, lot's of changes...I really should have updated this file and didn't -- shame on me.
- I did add a lot of info to the readme though --- please be sure to read that.


/*********************************************************************/
Release notes for php-syslog-ng 2.9.1:
I've taken the 2.8 version, fixed a few bugs/annoyances and added an install interface.
To use the installer, just create an empty (writeable) config.php in the config/ directory and point
your browser to http://yourserver/install

I've also added a perl script to generate fake events located at scripts/dbgen.pl

Added the Cisco Error Message Database (CEMDB)
 - The CEMDB includes a MySQL table of all cisco errors available (~25k entries).
 - It will automatically display more information about any Cisco-based event that comes in.
 - Note that you must have javascript enabled for this to display.
To enable this feature, your config file requires two entries:
define('CEMDB', 'ON');
define('CISCO_ERROR_TABLE', 'cemdb');
These entries are created if you use the installer.

I'm including the dumpfile for the CEMDB stuff - it can be found in install/sql/cemdb.sql
Note that scripts/cemdb/* is not needed, it's there for future updates of the cemdb.
All you need is the cemdb.sql file in the install directory.
* You may want to GZIP this file to save space, I'm leaving it uncompressed to the installer can use it
* Someone should write code to automatically uncompress and compress it as needed using the installer
* (I may if I have time)

- Clayton Dukes
- Lot's-o-props to Michael Freeman for his help on the emd.pl script! (mfreeman451@gmail.com)
/*********************************************************************/

/*********************************************************************/
* Release notes for php-syslog-ng 2.9.2:
* NEW CONFIG - If you are not using the install utility provided, please note that the 
* config/config.php file has changed -- see config.php.dist for an example.
/*********************************************************************/
- Lot's of minor fixes to 2.9.1
- Added Graphing capability on the main page
- To enable/disable Graphs, modify config.php
 * Be sure to create a cache directory (jpcache is the default) and make it writeable by the web user.
 * You may also want to add a cronjob to clean out the cache on a daily basis, like so:
 @daily find /path/to/web/directory/html/jpcache -atime 1 -exec rm -f '{}' ';'
 * This will delete files in that directory older then 1 day
- Note: If you see an error about a missing font, the be sure to install the MS ttf's (verdana.ttf). In Ubuntu, just type "aptitude install msttcorefonts", other OS's, please read http://www.mail-archive.com/php-syslog-ng-support@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00126.html
- Please read more about JPGraph here:
 http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/pdf/jpgraphddda.pdf
 Specifically, please note that it required GD libs to run!
- The full JPGRAPH library is included with this distribution located under includes/jpgraph
  It is the standard download - no modifications have been made to the source.


- Changed the size of host tables in the database from varchar(32) to varchar(128) -- my customer has *really* long dns names and they were getting truncated.
 To modify your installation, do the following from mysql:
 * alter table logs modify host varchar(128) default NULL; 
 * alter table search_cache modify value varchar(128) default NULL; 
 Then, be sure to clear your search cache:
 * delete from search_cache;

- Changed default searches to include only yesterday to today. In other words, if you leave the date fields blank on the main page and click search, it will only search from yesterday until today, not everything. I did this because users at my client site would just click search without selecting anything just to see what it does and then complain that it was slow :-)
 * To do this, I just modified regularresult.php and changed the following:
 $date = get_input('date'); 
 if (! $date) { 
 $date = "yesterday"; 
 }   
 $date2 = get_input('date2'); 
 if (! $date2) { 
 $date = "today"; 
 }   

- A couple of people have asked how to create a password for the admin manually through the DB interface, here's how:
 insert into users (username, pwhash) values ('admin', MD5("somepassword"));

- Modified reloadcache.php and added:
 $basePath = dirname( __FILE__ );
 include_once "$basePath/../includes/common_funcs.php";
 include_once "$basePath/../config/config.php";
 So that I could run a cron job every 5 minutes to update the cache:
 0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * php /www/php-syslog-ng/html/scripts/reloadcache.php >> /var/log/reloadcache.log

- Modified dbgen.pl and made it more random -- including random hosts now.
  * Also cleaned up the code some in it.

- Modified scripts/syslog2mysql.sh so that it uses syslogadmin instead of syslogfeeder (I don't see a need for a separate syslogfeeder account)

- Modified many of the files to use $basePath parameter instead of relative paths
$basePath = dirname( __FILE__ );
include_once "$basePath/../includes/common_funcs.php";
include_once "$basePath/../config/config.php";

- Modified META refresh tags on login and logout to use JS instead of META since it's faster and doesn't try to modify header information.

- Overlib (javascript popup)
You guys are more than welcome to make it better if you like.
The javascript being used is from overLIB
3.51(http://www.bosrup.com/web/overlib)
Yes, I am aware there are later version available, but this version is
much smaller and easier to use (but sacrifices more features).

Release notes for php-syslog-ng 2.7:
This release only contains bug fixes. See the changelog for the complete list of changes.
If you are using the merge table then you need to use MySQL 4.0.18 or later.

-Claus

# END

2.8
* Fixed a bug in logrotate.php (http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7674217&forum_id=34099).

2.7
* Fixed some more issues with undeclared variables 
  (http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7433359&forum_id=34099
  and 
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7568291&forum_id=34099).
- Fixed problem when passing arrays through POST or GET requests and running PHP without 
  having magic quotes enabled (http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7568291&forum_id=34099).
- Fixed a bug in the page counter at the bottom of the regularresult.php 
  page. The count was incorrect when you moved past page five.
- Changed the CREATE statement for the merge table in logrotate.php because it failed 
  on some systems (it should now work on any version of MySQL 4.0.18 or later).
- Changed logrotate.php to drop the temp table if it exists (it could 
  possibly be created during a failed run and then the script would fail on all subsequent runs).

2.6
* More code clean-up and commenting.
- Added an error message on failed login.
- Did some work towards supporting other databases.
- Option to reset other users' passwords.
- Cache function for the search page.
- Access controls. The access controls currently only affects various configuration specific items (add/deleting users, changing the access control settings etc).
- Changed the database field on the search page so that you only have to pick a table if you have more than one table.
- Fixed bug in get_logtables() (http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7433359&forum_id=34099).
- Fixed issue with persistent MySQL connections. db_connect_syslog() now only uses mysql_pconnect() if it is available.
- Fixed issue with undeclared variables. Some versions of PHP produce 
  lots of errors/warnings/notices when variables are not declared before they are used.


2.5.4
* More code clean-up and commenting.
- Added authentication. It can be enabled by setting REQUIRE_AUTH in config.php. 
  Authentication also requires a new table and a create statement was added to the 
  dbsetup.sql script. For authentication to work you also need to run the new GRANT 
  statement for the regular user (GRANT UPDATE ON syslog.users TO sysloguser@localhost;). 
  You should also add a user so that you are able to log in (you can add more users once you are logged in). 
  INSERT INTO users (username, pwhash) VALUES('admin', 'd033e22ae348aeb5660fc2140aec35850c4da997'); 
  will add a user 'admin' with password 'admin'.
- Added a new field to the search page. If you have multiple tables with log data then 
  you will get a dropdown where you can select what table to search. Unless you only 
  have one table or have a merge table that covers all tables then you have to pick a 
  table to work with before the rest of the form is displayed.
- Changed the logrotate.php script to handle merge tables. This feature can be turned 
  on and off using MERGELOGTABLE in config.php. When active then the logrotate.php will 
  create a merge table covering all log tables whenever it's run. In order for this change 
  to work you need to allow the admin user to have RELOAD priviliges. 
  GRANT RELOAD ON *.* TO syslogadmin@localhost; will take care of that. 
  You should not attempt to run the logrotate script more than once per day.
- Changed the logrotate.php script to enable deleting outdated tables. This 
  feature can be turned on and off using LOGROTATERETENTION in config.php. 
  LOGROTATERETENTION specifies the number of days to keep old logs. Log tables with a 
  datestamp older than today minus LOGROTATERETENTION will be deleted whenever logrotate.php is run.
- Fixed a bug that caused the exclude option for PRIORITY to malfunction 
  (http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7376135&forum_id=34099).
- Fixed a bug that could result in collapsing identical messages from different hosts into one message.
- Included a help page. If the database is unavailable then this page is the default page.
- A few cosmetic changes to the user interface.
- Implemented input validation for almost all input.

2.5.3
* Complete top-to-bottom clean-up of the code including large parts that were re-written.
- Simplified much of the HTML ... but tried to stay true to the original look.
- Changed the way the total number of results is calculated. My approach requires 
  MySQL 4.0 or later. This way you can use a LIMIT statement and still get the total 
  number of potential results if you had not used LIMIT. Also implemented an option to 
  turn off this feature if using older versions of MySQL (no count will be displayed on 
  older versions of MySQL).
- Changed the list of result pages. It lists links to the 11 closest pages and adds 
  FIRST, PREV, NEXT and LAST links. This only works correct when you have a total row 
  count but limited functionality is offered for MySQL 3.x users (First, Prev and Next links).
- The max-limit input variable is probably mostly useless now so it was removed.
- Added sorting by column (seq, facility, severity, datetime).
- Changed the way to and from times/dates are handled. A blank date field indicates any date. 
  And if a date is entered and no time is specified then 00:00:00 is used for the FROM 
  time and 23:59:59 is used for the TO time. Entering a time without a date results in 
  the time being ignored.
- 'now', 'today' and 'yesterday' are valid values for the date inputs on the search page (now and today are the same).
- 'now' is valid value for the time inputs on the search page.
- Did some prep work to allow an arbitrary number of inputs when searching for specific messages.
- The hostname link on the result page (for both the regular result and the 
  tail result) narrows down the search to only include that particular host.
- The results in the tail script can be narrowed down using many of the same variables as the regular search result.
- MySQL functions that include basic database error handling.
- Added a button on the search page to go straight to the tail result page.
- Added an option to collapse consecutive lines with identical messages into one line.
- Included some sample scripts for setup etc (create database and database users, 
  logrotate, syslog to mysql).
